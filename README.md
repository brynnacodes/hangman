# _Hangman_

#### _A word guessing game._

#### By _**Keith Evans & Brynna Klamkin-McCarter**_

## Description

_This simple word guessing game randomly generates a word from a predetermined list, then allows users to guess at the letters in the word, turn by turn. If the user guesses correctly, they can proceed and the stick figure remains the same. If the user guesses incorrectly, another part of the "man" is drawn. If the user guesses wrong 6 times, they lose and the "man" is hanged._
